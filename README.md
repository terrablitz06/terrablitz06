##### My 5 favorite Rotmg Dungeons:
1. The Nest (I have yet to get the ST trap from KBQ [P.S The Nest is actually very easy imo. The only hard phases imo of KBQ are her phase 6 shotgun and phase 7 chase])
2. Cultist Hideout (Scary at first, but as long as you don't afk on boss [Trust me you don't wanna. I lost my 8/8 assassin to it when I decided to afk for a few seconds], you're fine [P.S. Paralyze cultists on Malus phase 3 and 4 sucks])
3. Oryx's Sanctuary (I have yet to beat O3 so no tips from me. I just like the ost (Apostasy) and the visuals of the floors and walls when Leucoryx.)
4. Woodland Labyrinth (The boss may seem overwhelming at first, but as long as you dodge, this dungeon is very fun, and not to mention leaf bow is quite nice. [P.S. Generally, for all classes, I tend to stand in front of the boss and move in the direction that the megamoth is moving since it is very slow in all phases anyways. Just be careful to make distance between you and the boss, because it can one-shot most classes.])
5. Mountain Temple (A mix of moderate difficulty and quite nice UTs [except for Jade Storm], and not to mention the guaranteed T-Room is always located in a single spot. Though when not rushed, mountain temple can get painfully long, especially when trying to light all lanterns for t-room.)
